`npm install wifi-status -g`

Prints out a more honest wifi status than the mac bar:

```
$ wifi-status
KD WLAN Hotspot+ ðŸ”“
WiFi Signal:	 [|||                ] 20
WiFi Noise:	 [                   ] 8
```

There is a `--live` option for continous bars, useful for running around
to find a better reception.
